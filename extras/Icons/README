Icons by James Shepherdson (https://github.com/jashephe)
The main icon is entirely an Inkscape SVG (because I made it from scratch).  The document icons use Apple's document icon backgounds, which are rasters.  The movie document template comes from Quicktime X with the Quicktime X icon removed.  All of icons were generated from these SVGs.
