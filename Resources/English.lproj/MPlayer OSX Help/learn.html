						With it's intuitive controls, and a clean, slick and uncluttered interface panel, using MPlayer will be a breeze for
						anyone. The interface is designed to closely resemble the Apple Quicktime player interface, so using MPlayer will be
						seamless to all users.
						<br/>
						You can open movies by just doublecklicking on the icon, or you can drag the movie file onto the MPlayer interface, 
						and just simply drop it...and your movie will start playing automatically
						<br/>
						MPlayer OSX also sports a very nice playlist manager, where movies can be added using simple drag and drop. To show or
						hide the playlist, just click on the <b>PL</b> button, located in the lower right corner of the MPlayer OSX interface.

						MPlayer for linux was originally a command line application, with the graphical users interfaces arriving much later
						than MPlayer was initially created. Although MPlayer OSX is a full fledged and nicely designed Cocoa application,
						underneath it's hood is a powerful command line utility, that lets you do virtually anything you desire with your
						multimedia content.
						<br/>
						The command line version of MPlayer lets you specify numerous options that control multimedia content playback, such
						as selecting different video / audio output drivers, setting postprocessing to values that suit your need, or rebuild
						a broken index on a movie. All this, and much, much more is at the tip of your fingers.
